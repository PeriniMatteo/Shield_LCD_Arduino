# Shield_LCD_Arduino
Electronic circuit sketch and code for prototyping Arduino board buit
on pass-through hole

see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystal for original code,
in this code some attaches have been change to ease the electrical
circuit soldering on pass-through hole:
 
  attach LCD RS pin to digital pin 2 instead of digital pin 12
 
  attach LCD Enable pin to digital pin 3 instead of digital pin 11
 
  attach LCD D4 pin to digital pin 4 instead of digital pin 5
  
  attach LCD D5 pin to digital pin 5 instead of digital pin 4
 
  attach LCD D6 pin to digital pin 6 instead of digital pin 3
 
  attach LCD D7 pin to digital pin 7 instead of digital pin 2
